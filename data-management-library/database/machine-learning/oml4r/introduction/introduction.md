# Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R)

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will use a dataset representing about 15,000 customers of an insurance company. Each customer has about 30 attributes, and the goal is to train the model to predict a given customer's life-time value (LTV) using regression algorithms, and additionally, using classification algorithms to classify customers as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or VERY HIGH LTV (using binned LTV categories).

Estimated Time:  2 hours 50 min

### **About Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R)**

Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) makes the open-source R statistical programming language and environment ready for enterprise and big data. Designed for problems involving large and small data volumes, OML4R integrates R with Oracle Database.

Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) enables you to use R (a statistical programming language) for statistical analysis, data exploration, machine learning, and graphical analysis of data stored in an Oracle database. This allows you to benefit from the simplicity of R and the power of Oracle Database without the need to deal with the complexities of sourcing, moving, and securing data. OML4R is the new name for Oracle R Enterprise.

Data scientists and broader R users can use the R ecosystem on data managed by Oracle Database. R provides software packages for data manipulation, graphics, statistical functions, and machine learning algorithms. Oracle Machine Learning for R extends R's capabilities through three primary areas: transparent access and manipulation of database data from R, in-database machine learning algorithms, and ease of deployment using embedded R execution.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Establish a connection from RStudio to your Oracle Database instance to prepare, explore, and visualize data.
* Use R for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data organization (bucketing of data in train and test buckets),
* Use Attribute Importance, Principle Component Analysis, Model Building, and Model Validations techniques.
* Use OML4R Regression model for estimating customer lifetime value (LTV).
* Use OML4R Classification models for LTV_BIN assignment for unassigned customers.
* Validate predictions using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and Confusion Matrix methods.


### Prerequisites

* Oracle Database 21c, 19c, or 18c installed on-premises (or in a VM in Cloud);
* R, RStudio, and required libraries
