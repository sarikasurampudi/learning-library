# Prepare Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to download the Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file needed to setup the resource needed to run this workshop. We would use in the next lab to create an compute instance needed to run the lab tasks.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 15 minutes

### Objectives
-   Download ORM stack need to create Compute Instance(Virtual Machine) for this workshop.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- An Oracle Free Tier or Paid Cloud account
- Have sufficient quota for in your tenancy to create VM and VCN.

## Task 1: Download Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) stack zip file
1.  Click on the link below to download the Resource Manager zip file you need to build your environment: [oml4r-mkplc-freetier.zip](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/qZjEnLD0vWMY4nXqfnhtPGP7G18XT0iRwPRliMvK0k1JAYIdzXu9lsc_msHxcRd-/n/oraclepartnersas/b/omlvm-mkplc-freetier/o/oml4r-mkplc-freetier.zip)

2.  Save the **oml4r-mkplc-freetier.zip** file in your machine and note the folder location.

## Task 2: Setup Compute   
Using the details from the above task, proceed to the lab *Environment Setup* to setup your workshop environment using Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) and one of the following options:
  -  Create Stack:  *Compute only* with an existing VCN where security lists have been updated in the resource stack.

Note: All the resources include R-Studio and Oracle Database are already setup in the Sandbox VM we are creating using the stack provided in previous step, hence there is not need to create ssh keys and access the instance using SSH or other method.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
