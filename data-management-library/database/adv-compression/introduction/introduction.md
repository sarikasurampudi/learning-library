# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Advanced Compression provides a comprehensive set of compression features to reduce costs and improve performance by enabling compression for structured data, unstructured data, indexes and backups. Although storage cost savings and optimization across servers is the most tangible benefit, all of the features with Advanced Compression are designed to improve performance across components of your IT infrastructure, including memory, network bandwidth and storage. In this hands-on lab, we will work on compression based hands-on labs to understand the compression concepts and their corresponding use cases.

Estimated Time:  2 hour 20 minutes

### Data compression can significantly reduce storage cost

The amount of data that enterprises are storing, and managing, is overgrowing - various industry estimates indicate that data volume is doubling every 2-3 years. This exponential growth of data presents daunting challenges for IT. First and foremost are storage costs: even though the cost of storage has been declining dramatically, the enormous increase in the volume of data still makes storage one of the most significant cost elements of most IT budgets. In addition, as databases grow at accelerating rates, it is challenging to continue to meet performance requirements while staying within budget.

### Key Features
 
* Reduces database storage requirements and associated costs. 
* Typically improves query performance. 
* Compresses OLTP and data warehousing application tables. 
* Data in memory remains in compressed format. 
* Compresses structured, unstructured, index, backup, network and Data Guard redo logs transport data. 
* Heat Map collects segment/block-level data usage information used to define Automatic Data Optimization compression and storage tiering policies. 
* Cascades storage savings throughout the data centre. 
* Reduces the size of all supported unique and non-unique indexes while still providing efficient access to the indexes. 
* It can be used with any application without application changes. 
* Reduces the size of the session data unit (SDU) transmitted over a data connection. 
* Reduces the cost of storing and accessing historical data.
